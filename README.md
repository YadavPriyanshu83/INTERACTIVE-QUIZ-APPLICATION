PROJECT: Real-Time Chat Application
TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED
Welcome to the Interactive Quiz Application – a simple yet powerful web-based quiz platform built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and is designed to deliver a seamless and engaging experience for users who want to test their knowledge in a fun and interactive way. Whether you're a student revising for exams, a teacher creating quick assessments, or just someone who enjoys trivia, this application is perfect for quick quizzes. With its clean interface, responsive layout, and real-time feedback, it serves as a solid example of how front-end technologies can come together to create something both useful and enjoyable.This project allows users to take a multiple-choice quiz where each question is displayed one at a time. The user selects an answer from a list of options, receives immediate feedback, and at the end of the quiz, a final score is presented. The entire application runs on the client-side and doesn’t require any server or backend database, making it lightweight and easy to deploy or share. It’s an excellent project for beginner or intermediate developers who want to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and JavaScript logic. HTML5: For creating the structure of the quiz interface, buttons, question layout, and overall content. CSS3: For styling the interface, including layout, colors, buttons, transitions, and responsiveness. JavaScript (Vanilla): For implementing quiz logic, including dynamic question display, scoring, user input handling, and feedback. Visual Studio Code: Used as the primary code editor for development, debugging, and previewing with extensions like Live Server.
